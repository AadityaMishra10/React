This is a React component that creates a web application that fetches text data from a URL entered by the user, generates a frequency histogram of the most common words in the text, and displays the histogram in a bar chart using the recharts library. The user can also export the histogram data to a CSV file.

Plugins installed in this code are:

react: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
recharts: a charting library based on React and D3
axios: a library for making HTTP requests
The component has two states:

fileUrl: a string representing the URL of the text data entered by the user
histogramData: an array of objects representing the word frequency data for the histogram chart
The component has three main functions:

fetchHistogramData: a function that fetches the text data from the URL entered by the user, processes the data to generate the word frequency data, and sets the histogramData state with the frequency data.
downloadCsv: a function that generates a CSV file containing the word frequency data and triggers a download of the file in the user's browser.
render: a function that renders the UI elements of the application using JSX. The UI includes an input field for entering the URL, a button for submitting the URL, a bar chart for displaying the word frequency data, and a button for exporting the data to a CSV file. When the user submits the URL, the fetchHistogramData function is called, which updates the histogramData state and causes the chart and export button to be displayed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
